Undeterred by the plethora of new tools and technologies he was introduced to in our tech stack, he showed a passion and enthusiasm for learning and mastering them. I was impressed at how quickly he picked up complex concepts and began contributing to our codebase within his first week on the job. Over the course of the summer, Ivan helped us add more end to end test coverage to the app, and built an error page for the site which directs customers to our customer support portal. Some of Ivan's key strengths are his communication skills and his willingness to ask for help. This is something that is tough for a lot of people, especially software engineers, and Ivan really excels at this. We would be happy to host him again as an intern!",
